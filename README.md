# MF50
Capacitive replacement PCB for the IBM M50.

This PCB is designed for the M50. Although it shares the F50's matrix and bears similarities to the capacitive PCB from the F50, it is not designed to be compatible or an exact replacement. However, I think it is likely it would fit in the F50.

I have tested this in my own M50. I ordered it from JLCPCB with 0.6mm thickness. 

It is designed to be used with the SMD Model F Controller: https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=24597

I used the "standard" version of the controller, and it fit nicely - but not precisely - in the bottom case.

I do not know if it is compatible with the "4704" version of the controller.

QMK-xwhatsit firmware made by purdeaandrei can be found here: http://35.164.28.200:5000/#/xwhatsit/ibm/f50/universal/LAYOUT

I have not tested this with normal xwhatsit firmware.
